                <h2>Python</h2>
                <p>I began learning Python during my A-Levels, where I developed a strong interest in programming. I built a solid understanding of its core concepts and studied Data Structures and Algorithms, which strengthened my programming logic and problem-solving skills. In my first year at university, I further developed my knowledge by exploring advanced topics such as GUI development and created an ATM simulator using tkinter, featuring PIN authentication, ability to deposit and withdraw money, and error handling. Outside coursework, I developed a Sudoku solver using Object Oriented Programming, which further helped me improve my coding skills.</p>

                <h2>Web Development</h2>
                <p>During my first year at university, I began learning web development, where I was introduced to HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. I enjoyed creating responsive layouts and focusing on user experience while building projects like Snack-Man, Fitness Tracker App, and To-Do List. To enhance my skills, I also took online courses and continued practicing on my own, which helped me grow into a more confident and capable front-end developer.</p>

                <h2>Java</h2>
                <p>As I continued into my second year at university, I started working with Java, an important programming language widely used in software development. Alongside learning the basics, I explored core concepts such as Object-Oriented Programming (OOP), file handling, and error handling, which helped me fully understand these concepts and apply them in various projects. I am continuing to expand my knowledge of Java and aim to polish my skills further by applying them to increasingly complex projects.</p>

                <i class="fa-brands fa-php"></i>
                <h2>PHP</h2>
                <p>After building a strong foundation in front-end development, I was introduced to PHP in my next year at university to learn backend development and create more dynamic websites. I found PHP both interesting and fun to work with. Alongside it, I also learned about databases and used MySQL to connect my website to a database, allowing users to store and update information directly through the browser. I developed features like login and registration pages and also studied different methods of structuring the code to make future development easier.</p>
