                <h2>ATM Machine</h2>
                <p>During my first year at my University, I had a module, Problem solving and Programming, where I studied Python as a programming language. As an assignment I created a Python program that simulateds the core functionality of an ATM machine. This program intereracts with the user in the console and handles any common errors that occur. The project demonstrates my programming skills and logical thinking, and ability to solve complex problems. </p>

                <p>In my second year at University, I learned Web Programming, which included HTML, CSS and Javascript. As part of a group project, my team created a Fitness Tracking App that allowed users to input their workouts, track the number of calories burned, and visualise their progress through a bar chart. This project greatly improved my Front-End development skills and motivated me to pursue it further in my career</p>

                <h2>Tetris</h2>
                <p>After graduating from University, I recreated the classic game of Tetris using Python, a language in which I had become proficient by the end of my studies. This was my first ever individual game project, which I worked on.I developed it further by adding new, challenging levels and making it multiplayer, allowing players to compete with their friends. This project helped me polish my programming skills and gave me valuable experience in game development.</p>

                <h2>Call of Duty</h2>
                <p>Following my passion for game development, I joined the renowned American company, Infinity Ward. Together with a group of talented individuals, I contributed to the creation of the famous shooting video game, Call Of Duty. This was one of my favourite project I ever worked on, as it became a huge success and gained widespread popularity. The game was developed using C and C++ programming languages. This project showcases my proficiency in various programming languages. </p>
